// Buffer is the text an editor edits, with its undo history and its
// language. Several editors, and both sides of a DiffView, can show one
// buffer: an edit in one shows in the others, their carets and
// selections moving with the text around them, and undo takes back the
// buffer's last edit, whichever editor made it, as in Zed.
//
// The text is a persistent tree of chunks: an edit copies a few
// kilobytes and a path of the tree, whatever the size of the document,
// and each version shares the rest with the one before, so frames and
// other goroutines read a version (Snapshot) without locks. Undo history
// keeps the edits that take each step back, which EditRemote moves past
// edits made elsewhere. Offsets count bytes of UTF-8, and a Pos a line
// and the bytes into it.
//
// Lines end in \n, as in Zed: a text set with \r\n line endings keeps
// \n ones, and LineEnding says which it had, which WriteTo writes.
//
// Methods are safe from any goroutine; schedule changes with
// Window.Update so the window shows them.
