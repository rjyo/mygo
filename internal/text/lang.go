// The language of a text decides the glyphs of the scripts it writes,
// which some fonts draw apart by language, as the Han characters Chinese
// and Japanese share, and the fonts the system falls back to for them.
// Han characters in a text of a language that does not write them, as a
// Chinese name in an English sentence, keep the glyphs the system picks
// for them by the user's settings, as they had without a language: the
// language says nothing of them, and an English app shown to a reader of
// Japanese should not draw a Japanese name with Chinese glyphs. Browsers
// do the same (Chromium's LayoutLocale::LocaleForHan). Core Text does it
// by itself; DirectWrite and Pango are told (cjkRuns).
//
// On Windows the user's settings are more than the locale of their
// regional formats, which DirectWrite falls back by. DirectWrite's fallback
// for English draws Chinese text in Yu Gothic UI, a Japanese font, where it
// has the characters, and in Microsoft JhengHei UI, a Traditional Chinese
// one, where it lacks them, strokes of two weights in one label (#1454):
// a user of English Windows who reads Chinese lists it among their
// preferred languages. Han characters in no language that writes them take
// the first of those that does (userHanLanguage), as Chromium takes the
// first of its accepted languages.
