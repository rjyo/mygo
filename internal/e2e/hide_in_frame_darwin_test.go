// content as it builds a frame, and the content goes on asking for a
// frame in each: the main thread still runs what is posted to it. The
// window server tells that the window left the screen a pass of the run
// loop later, and package ui holds no frame until then: drawn at once
// each, from the backend's queue, those frames never let that pass come.
// TestHideInFrame hides its window as soon as it has it, before it shows
// on screen unless the runner is slow, and hung only then.
